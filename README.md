## My favorite movie

My favorite movie is **The Lord of the rings**. The movie is a trilogy consisting of the parts **The Fellowship of the Ring**, **The Two Towers**, and
**The Return of the King**. It all started with **The Fellowship of the Ring** where a prologue narrated by Galadriel explains the history of the One Ring and Sauron's
rise to power. The story shifts to the peaceful Shire, where Frodo Baggins inherits the One Ring from his uncle, Bilbo. Gandalf reveals the Ring’s dark history and
Sauron’s connection to it, prompting Frodo to set out on a journey to Rivendell with his friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin. At Rivendell, a council forms the Fellowship of
the Ring, consisting of Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Boromir. Their mission is to destroy the Ring in Mount Doom. Along the way, the
Fellowship faces internal conflicts and enemy attacks, eventually fracturing. The movie ends with Frodo and Sam continuing the journey alone, while Aragorn, Legolas,
and Gimli set out to rescue Merry and Pippin, who have been captured by orcs. In **The Two Towers**, the story picks up immediately after the Fellowship's separation.
Frodo and Sam, guided by Gollum, journey deeper into Mordor, while Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli pursue the orcs holding Merry and Pippin. Their pursuit leads them to
Rohan, a kingdom under siege by Saruman, Sauron’s ally. Gandalf returns as Gandalf the White and helps rally Rohan’s forces to victory in the Battle of Helm’s Deep.
Merry and Pippin escape and enlist the help of the Ents, ancient tree-like beings, who destroy Saruman’s stronghold at Isengard. The film concludes with Rohan
victorious, the Ents triumphant, and Frodo and Sam continuing their journey into Mordor as Gollum secretly plots to betray them. In **The Return of the King**, a
flashback reveals how Sméagol became Gollum after finding the One Ring. The story then focuses on Frodo and Sam's treacherous journey through Mordor, Aragorn preparing
to lead his forces against Sauron, and Gandalf aiding Gondor in the face of an impending siege at Minas Tirith. Aragorn accepts his destiny as the true king of Gondor
and leads a united force from Rohan and Gondor in the massive Battle of the Pelennor Fields. To distract Sauron and buy Frodo time, Aragorn leads a small army to the
Black Gate of Mordor. Frodo, overcome by the Ring’s power, refuses to destroy it at Mount Doom, but Gollum seizes the Ring and falls into the fire, destroying himself
and the Ring. Sauron is defeated, his armies collapse, and peace returns to Middle-earth. Aragorn is crowned king, and the hobbits return to the Shire. The story
concludes with Frodo, scarred by his journey, leaving Middle-earth with Gandalf and the elves for the Undying Lands, while Sam settles into a peaceful life with his
family.
